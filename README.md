# SELF NOTES : HOW THIS WILL BE DONE
###### hey, if you're reading this, stick around!

Since I am following KaupenJoe's series, and I have a fried new-gen brain, I'll be applying every episode's material into a class in JavaSkills, this way, I can retain information and also have a reference going forward.

- sincerely, cloudz_code / tempestcloudz

  self note for day 1:
  - after commiting changes, ***push*** them to move them from the local repository (git / intelliJ) to Github
 
day 2
- huh, apparently I didn't need to write in this every day ! Well, I'll keep up documentation, adding the math functions was a lil' tuff
  to wrap my head around tho.

day 3
- finally got my shiet done, noted, if you wanna group two classes together, make a folder for them!! no brainer 'till you forget to do it!!

day 4
- forgot to document yesterday lmfao, so day 5 will also be today hwaha, it was pretty good now that I think about it

day 5
- finished episode 9, leap year problem was a hell of a doozy, got it tho! excited for the next day.

day 6
- added episode 10, for some reason GitHub is putting it next to episode 1??? (might fix later)

day 7 (six seven!)
- added episode 11, easy episode, but likely the calm before the storm.
