# SELF NOTES : HOW THIS WILL BE DONE
###### hey, if you're reading this, stick around!

Since I am following KaupenJoe's series, and I have a fried new-gen brain, I'll be applying every episode's material into a class in JavaSkills, this way, I can retain information and also have a reference going forward.

- sincerely, cloudz_code / tempestcloudz

  self note for day 1:
  - after commiting changes, ***push*** them to move them from the local repository (git / intelliJ) to Github
