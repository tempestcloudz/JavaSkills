# SELF NOTES : HOW THIS WILL BE DONE
###### hey, if you're reading this, stick around!

Since I am following KaupenJoe's series, and I have a fried new-gen brain, I'll be applying every episode's material into a class in JavaSkills, this way, I can retain information and also have a reference going forward.
